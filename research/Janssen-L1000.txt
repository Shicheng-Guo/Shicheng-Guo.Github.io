Janssen will generate gene-expression profiles from 250,000 compounds from Janssen’s small-molecule screening library using its proprietary L1000™ Expression Profiling technology. This is the first time gene-expression profiling has been applied at this scale, and this multi-year contract showcases a commitment to high-throughput gene-expression profiling for multiple drug discovery and development applications. The data will be used for primary screening and library characterization as well as to improve the selection of 
candidate drugs prior to clinical studies.
