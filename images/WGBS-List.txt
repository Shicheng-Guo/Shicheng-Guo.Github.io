Methylation profiling by high throughput sequencing



1. Altered chromosomal topology drives oncogenic programs in SDH-deficient GIST
(Submitter supplied) Epigenetic aberrations are widespread in cancer, yet the underlying mechanisms and causality remain poorly understood. A subset of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)  lack canonical kinase mutations but instead have succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficiency and global DNA hyper-methylation. Here we associate this hyper-methylation with changes in genome topology that activate oncogenic programs. more...

Epigenetic information, such as brain DNA methylation patterns, is predicted to reveal insight into the gene networks, cell types, and developmental timing of ASD etiology, but prior methylation studies in ASD have been limited by platform or data integration. more...

4. Archaic and modern bone DNA methylation maps from the Neanderthal, Denisovan, modern human and chimpanzee
(Submitter supplied) Regulatory changes are broadly accepted as key drivers of phenotypic divergence. However, identifying regulatory changes that underlie human-specific traits has proven very challenging. Here, we use 63 DNA methylation maps of ancient and present-day humans, as well as of six chimpanzees, to detect differentially methylated regions that emerged in modern humans after the split from Neanderthals and Denisovans. more...

14. DNMT3B maintains mCA landscape and regulates mCG status of bivalent promoters in human embryonic stem cells
(Submitter supplied) In mammalian cells, DNMT3B is known as a de novo DNA methyltransferase. However, its preferential target sites for DNA methylation are largely unknown. By studying CA methylation (mCA) and various histone mark distributions in human embryonic stem cells (hESC), we set up a connection between mCA, H3K36me3, and DNMT3B. We found that mCA, H3K36me3 and DNMT3B signals in hESC are distributed in a 3-level pattern: low level at promoter region, intermediate level before first splicing junction and high level afterward. more...

Here, we perform Repli-Seq and integrated epigenome analyses and demonstrate that genomic regions that undergo long-range epigenetic deregulation in prostate cancer also show concordant differences in replication timing. more...

18. DNA hypermethylation encroachment at CpG island borders in cancer is predisposed by H3K4 monomethylation [WGBS_Hs]
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation plays a key role in demarcation of regulatory regions, including promoter-associated CpG islands. While CpG islands are typically maintained in an unmethylated state in normal cells, a proportion of CpG islands are subject to hypermethylation in cancer cells. It still remains elusive how the exquisite demarcation of the bimodal methylation state is established and maintained at the CpG island flanks and conversely what triggers the erosion of CpG island DNA methylation in tumorigenesis. more...

We introduce a novel method of Guide Positioning Sequencing (GPS) for precisely detecting whole genome DNA methylation and applied GPS as well as ChIP-seq and RNA-seq in normal liver cells and hepatoma cell lines to find how abberant DNA-methylation affect gene expression and cell identity during tumorigenesis and metastasis. We systematically found that the methylation difference between genebody and promoter is an effective predictor for gene expression with a correlation coefficient of 0.7. more...

(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation in CpG context is fundamental to the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in high eukaryotes. Disorganization of methylation status is implicated in many diseases, cellular differentiation, imprinting, and other biological processes. Techniques that enrich for biologically relevant CpG-rich genomic regions are desired since, depending on the size of an oragnism's methylome, the depth of sequencing required to cover all CpGs can be prohibitively expensive. more...

Using genome-wide analysis, we have discovered a postnatal pathway involving gender-specific demethylation that occurs exclusively in the male liver.  This demodification is programmed to take place at tissue-specific enhancer sequences, and our data show that the methylation state at these loci is associated with and appears to play a role in the transcriptional regulation of nearby genes. more...

37. Two-Track Epigenetic Remodeling and Backtracking to Embryonic Stem Cell Bivalency in B-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemias
(Submitter supplied) This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.

38. WGBS data of pediatric B-cell acute leukemias
(Submitter supplied) We investigated DNA methylomes of 227 pediatric B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) using whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and high-definition microarrays, along with RNA expression profiles. The current study identified a link between DNA methylome of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (B-ALLs) and embryonic stem cell (ESC) bivalency, through which tumor cells can mimic the pluripotency of ESCs.

39. Genomic and epigenomic architectures of monozygotic twins discordant for child acute lymphoblastic leukemia
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation appears to play an essential mechanistic role in the pathogenesis of ALL, thereby potentiate its use as a biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis (Milani, Lundmark et al. 2010; Geng, Brennan et al. 2012; Sandoval, Heyn et al. 2013), and even a potential target of novel therapeutic approaches in ALL. In present study, we collected blood specimens for 4 pairs of monozygotic  twins (MZ) and 1 pair of dizygotic twin (DZ) that are discordant for ALL. more...

40. Whole-genome analysis of 5-hydroxymethylcytosines and 5-methylcytosines at base resolution in human brain
(Submitter supplied) 5-hydroxymethylcytosines (5hmC) is particularly abundant in mammalian brain with little-known functions. Here we present the first genome-wide and single-base-resolution maps of 5hmC and 5mC in human brain by combined application of TAB-Seq and MethylC-Seq. We report that the majority of modified cytosines are hydroxymethylated in adult human brain, a significant proportion of which are highly-hydroxymethylated with enrichment in active genic regions and distal-regulatory elements. more...
