Today, I just submitted the letter of intent for the interal grant application in Marshfiled Clinic Research Institute as the PI. Same with other grant, the first step of the application is submit letter of intent. You need prepare the title, PI/co-PIs, research abstract including background, hypothesis, aims, strategy and significance. You don't need to get signature from all the co-PIs in this step. Usually the research abstract should be less than 500 words. You should submit 2 potential reviewer to review your abstract. 

After you prepared these materials, you need to submit the information to "Intent to submit" from Research Hub (RH). Just input the information one by one. The whole process usually takes 5-10 mins. and then you will receive the confirmation email to let you know you can prepare the proposal now. usually, the proposal should be less than 6 page.
