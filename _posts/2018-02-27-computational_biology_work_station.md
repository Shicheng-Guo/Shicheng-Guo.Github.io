One of terrible things in marshfield clinic research institute ([MCRI](https://www.marshfieldresearch.org)) is that software/package install request. Any software even Rstudio, R, Python will be reviewed by ITS department for security issues. Furthermore, the review process usually takes 2-3 months which make the research become quite difficult. Lucky thing is we can submit request as soon as possible supposing you think the software will be potentially used in the coming month. Finally, [ITS]() don't provide the software list which have been approved. therefore, it is quite necessary to list them and I think it will be helpful for further research fellows in MCRI. 

Here are software/packages I requested in the past two years and I will real-time update the list: 

* R
* R-studio
* Python
* pycharm
* Perl
* BioEdit
* Eclipse+EPIC
* Endnote
* Adobe Illustrator/inkscape
* Adobe Photoshop
* MEGA7
* Filezilla
* Cytoscape
* Haploview
* Notepad++
* NCBI-Cn3D
* MiKTex
* WINSCP
* Mendeley
* Evernote/Zotero
* Zoom
* IGV/IGVtools
* Julia
* Rust
* GATK
* Picard
* Deep Variant
* Dragen
