On 01/19/2020, I will give a talk about "UK Biobank Whole-Exome Sequence Binary Phenome Analysis with Robust Region-Based Rare-Variant Test, The American Journal of Human Genetics, [December 19, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929719304331?via%3Dihub)" in Marshfield Clinic Research Institute. Please check the [PPT I prepared](https://github.com/Shicheng-Guo/Shicheng-Guo.Github.io/blob/master/tutorials/2020/Robust-SKAT-Shicheng-Guo-2020-MCRI.pptx). I have implemented the pipeline in Marshfield Clinic SuperServer HPC cluster. The Figure I prepare for this post is GWAS result for colon cancer (CRC), RA and ESCC. Several genes looks very interesting, for example SCL21A2.
