* Synthetic lethality has been successfully applied in cancer drug development. #BRCA and #PARP is an classic example. Cancer cells with both BRCA1/2 and PARP loss-of-function will induce the apoptosis and cell death. Olaparib is a #PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase #PARPP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary #BRCA1 or #BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. Recently, FDA approved Olaparib plus Bevacizumab as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks #angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A #VEGFA which is a growth factor protein that stimulates #angiogenesis in a variety of diseases. #VEGFA is upregulated in many tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor development and is a target in many developing cancer therapeutics.

* DNA driver mutation mediated drug-target is a fantastic strategy to accelerate anti-cancer drug development. Capmatinib is a MET inhibitor being evaluated as a treatment for first-line and previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METex14 mutations occur in 3-4% of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC cases and is a recognized oncogenic driver. MET exon 14 alterations result in increased MET protein levels due to disrupted ubiquitin-mediated degradation. MET belongs to receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor signaling pathway. A number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have now been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), including those targeted against epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and ROS1. 

* Sounds like a fancy #BsAbs technique! Saving 6-18 months of development time and reducing manufacturing costs by ~90%, WuXiBody™ platform enables almost any monoclonal antibody (mAb) sequence pair to be assembled into the bispecific construct (bispecific monoclonal antibody, #BsMAbs, #BsAbs) and its unique structural flexibility makes the platform convenient to build various formats with different valency (e.g., 2, 3 or 4 binding sites).
