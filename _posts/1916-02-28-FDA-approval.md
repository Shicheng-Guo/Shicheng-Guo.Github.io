* Synthetic lethality has been successfully applied in cancer drug development. #BRCA and #PARP is an classic example. Cancer cells with both BRCA1/2 and PARP loss-of-function will induce the apoptosis and cell death. Olaparib is a #PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase #PARPP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary #BRCA1 or #BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. Recently, FDA approved Olaparib plus Bevacizumab as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks #angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A #VEGFA which is a growth factor protein that stimulates #angiogenesis in a variety of diseases. #VEGFA is upregulated in many tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor development and is a target in many developing cancer therapeutics.

* DNA driver mutation mediated drug-target is a fantastic strategy to accelerate anti-cancer drug development. Capmatinib is a MET inhibitor being evaluated as a treatment for first-line and previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METex14 mutations occur in 3-4% of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC cases and is a recognized oncogenic driver. MET exon 14 alterations result in increased MET protein levels due to disrupted ubiquitin-mediated degradation. MET belongs to receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor signaling pathway. A number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have now been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), including those targeted against epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and ROS1. 

* Sounds like a fancy #BsAbs technique! Saving 6-18 months of development time and reducing manufacturing costs by ~90%, WuXiBody™ platform enables almost any monoclonal antibody (mAb) sequence pair to be assembled into the bispecific construct (bispecific monoclonal antibody, #BsMAbs, #BsAbs) and its unique structural flexibility makes the platform convenient to build various formats with different valency (e.g., 2, 3 or 4 binding sites).

* Welcome to attend ASCO-2020 #Janssen Oncology Virtual Newsroom to receive the latest result of our 4 cancer therapy pipelines: JNJ-4528 BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy Phase 1b/2 study in #multiple_myeloma; ERLEADA®(apalutamide) Phase 3 study in non-metastatic castration-resistant #prostate_cancer; and Phase 1 study of amivantamab (EGFRxMET bispecific antibody) in non-small cell #lung_cancer; and teclistamab (BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody) in #multiple_myeloma

* A recent Nature paper profiled lymphocytes subsets and major cytokines in a cohort of 326 patients. They found that decline of T cells, but not B cell, and elevated IL-6 correlated with disease severity. It explained why remdesivir, an antiviral drug target viral replication machinery, works better as early treatment. The reason is that the virus itself is not the only one that we are dealing with. Another paper in Cell showed that SARS-CoV-2 caused a unique signature in immune response (e.g. low IFN-I and III), compared to flu or RSV. Interestingly, the immune responses also vary with the amount of inoculated viruses. The paper also mentioned that the cytokine release syndrome is similar to a complication following CAR T treatment. The "new norm" for immunology and virology field might be to study the relations between virological activity and cytokine storm and unique immune response.

* Binimetinib (Mektovi) is a potent and selective oral mitogen-activated protein kinase 1/2 (MEK 1/2) inhibitor together with Encorafenib (small molecule FDA approved BRAF inhibitor). On June 27, 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of Encorafenib and binimetinib combination for patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with the BRAF V600E or V600K mutations. Binimetinib, non-competitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2. The inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2-dependent effector proteins and transcription factors which can result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling, lead to the inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in the production of various inflammatory cytokines including IL1, IL6 and TNF. MEK1/2 are themselves threonine and tyrosine kinases that possess a dual specificity. They subsequently contribute critically to the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are typically upregulated in a number of different tumor cell types.

* Methotrexate is an antifolate antimetabolite used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and cancer. Methotrexate is taken up into the cell by human reduced folate carriers (SLC19A1). In the cytoplasm, methotrexate is polyglutamated by folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS), which enhances its retention inside the cell. Both methotrexate and methotrexate-polyglutamate inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dihydrofolate into tetrahydrofolate, which is the active form of folic acid. Tetrahydrofolate is involved in many single-carbon transfer reactions, including the synthesis of DNA and RNA nucleotides. Inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) causes depletion of intracellular tetrahydrofolate, which has a cytotoxic effect, especially on rapidly dividing cells. Methotrexate-polyglutamate further inhibits de novo purine synthesis and thymidylate synthase, which contribute to methotrexate’s cytotoxic effects.

* Acute hepatic porphyrias are monogenic autosomal dominant hereditary disorders involving deficiencies in heme synthesis pathway in liver hepatocytes. 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS1) is controlled via a negative feedback loop by heme in the liver. low circulating levels of heme caused by genetic mutation stimulates the up-regulation of #ALAS1. The over-expression of ALAS1, in combination with downstream enzyme deficiencies, leads to the over-production and accumulation of toxic heme intermediates and cause acute hepatic porphyrias. Givosiran is a double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) directed at ALAS1 mRNA in hepatocytes. It is covalently bound to a ligand containing three N-acetylgalactosamine (#GalNAc) residues that facilitate uptake into hepatocytes via asialoglycoprotein receptors (#ASPGRs), which are highly expressed on the cell surface of hepatocytes. Following endocytosis into hepatocytes, the antisense strand of givosiran is loaded into an enzyme complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (#RISC), which uses the antisense strand to seek out and cleave the complementary mRNA to preventing the synthesis of the ALAS1 enzyme and leading to reduced circulating levels of neurotoxic heme intermediates.

* Tazemetostat is a FDA approved small molecule methyltransferase inhibitor for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma. #EZH2 is a methyltransferase subunit of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) which catalyzes multiple methylations of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27). Trimethylation of this lysine inhibits the transcription of genes associated with cell cycle arrest. #PRC2 is antagonized by the switch/sucrose non-fermentable (SWI/SNF) multiprotein complex. EZH2 over-expressed in lots of human cancers. Abnormal activation of EZH2 or loss of function mutations in SWI/SNF lead to hyper-trimethylation of #H3K27 and further leads to cancer cell de-differentiation which is a gain of cancer stem cell-like properties. de-differentiation can allow for cancer cell proliferation and exhibited worse outcome.
