* Synthetic lethality has been successfully applied in cancer drug development. #BRCA and #PARP is an classic example. Cancer cells with both BRCA1/2 and PARP loss-of-function will induce the apoptosis and cell death. Olaparib is a #PARP inhibitor, inhibiting poly ADP ribose polymerase #PARPP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary #BRCA1 or #BRCA2 mutations, which include some ovarian, breast, and prostate cancers. Recently, FDA approved Olaparib plus Bevacizumab as maintenance treatment for ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks #angiogenesis by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor A #VEGFA which is a growth factor protein that stimulates #angiogenesis in a variety of diseases. #VEGFA is upregulated in many tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor development and is a target in many developing cancer therapeutics.

* DNA driver mutation mediated drug-target is a fantastic strategy to accelerate anti-cancer drug development. Capmatinib is a MET inhibitor being evaluated as a treatment for first-line and previously treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic MET exon 14 skipping (METex14) mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METex14 mutations occur in 3-4% of newly diagnosed advanced NSCLC cases and is a recognized oncogenic driver. MET exon 14 alterations result in increased MET protein levels due to disrupted ubiquitin-mediated degradation. MET belongs to receptor tyrosine kinase/growth factor signaling pathway. A number of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have now been approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), including those targeted against epidermal growth factor receptor, anaplastic lymphoma kinase, and ROS1. 

* Sounds like a fancy #BsAbs technique! Saving 6-18 months of development time and reducing manufacturing costs by ~90%, WuXiBody™ platform enables almost any monoclonal antibody (mAb) sequence pair to be assembled into the bispecific construct (bispecific monoclonal antibody, #BsMAbs, #BsAbs) and its unique structural flexibility makes the platform convenient to build various formats with different valency (e.g., 2, 3 or 4 binding sites).

* Welcome to attend ASCO-2020 #Janssen Oncology Virtual Newsroom to receive the latest result of our 4 cancer therapy pipelines: JNJ-4528 BCMA-directed CAR-T therapy Phase 1b/2 study in #multiple_myeloma; ERLEADA®(apalutamide) Phase 3 study in non-metastatic castration-resistant #prostate_cancer; and Phase 1 study of amivantamab (EGFRxMET bispecific antibody) in non-small cell #lung_cancer; and teclistamab (BCMAxCD3 bispecific antibody) in #multiple_myeloma

* A recent Nature paper profiled lymphocytes subsets and major cytokines in a cohort of 326 patients. They found that decline of T cells, but not B cell, and elevated IL-6 correlated with disease severity. It explained why remdesivir, an antiviral drug target viral replication machinery, works better as early treatment. The reason is that the virus itself is not the only one that we are dealing with. Another paper in Cell showed that SARS-CoV-2 caused a unique signature in immune response (e.g. low IFN-I and III), compared to flu or RSV. Interestingly, the immune responses also vary with the amount of inoculated viruses. The paper also mentioned that the cytokine release syndrome is similar to a complication following CAR T treatment. The "new norm" for immunology and virology field might be to study the relations between virological activity and cytokine storm and unique immune response.
