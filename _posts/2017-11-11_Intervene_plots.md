Today, I will give a talk about how to do multiple bedgraph data analysis with Intervene for ChIP-seq or MBD-seq data. Intervene is a tool for intersection and visualization of multiple genomic region and gene sets (or lists of items). Intervene provides an easy and automated interface for effective intersection and visualization of genomic region sets or lists of items, thus facilitating their analysis and interpretations.
