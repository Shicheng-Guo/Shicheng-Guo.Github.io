Today, I will give a talk about "Next generation protocol to bcftools in medical genetics research" in MCRI research hub meeting. As we know, bcftools, vcftools, plink, GATK have been widely used in medical genetics and population genetics research. The usage of these tools require lots of experiences. However, the original protocols are quite limited espeically lacking of real-data example. Here, I will provide the real-data examples and solution to most frequently problem we meet in the usage of these tools. 

#### bcftools view 
bcftools view is the most frequent command to use for SNPs filtering, sample filtering, format changing. 
```

```
#### bcftools annotation

#### plink2 

#### GATK

#### SnpSift
