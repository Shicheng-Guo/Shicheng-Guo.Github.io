* if you are the first time to use github, what you need to do first are: 
  * Get a github account
  * Download and install git.
  * Set up git with your user name and email
  
* Now I am assume you use Linux/Ubuntu, I don't use MAC
  * Open a terminal/shell and type to config your github:
  ```
   git config --global user.name "Your name here"
   git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
   git config --global color.ui true
  ```
  * you can make more config if you want, for example, if you want to use emacs:
  ```
  git config --global core.editor emacs
  ```
