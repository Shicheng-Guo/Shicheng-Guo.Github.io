Recently, I need to give a talk about electronic health/medical records (EHR/EMR) data analysis. Why we need analyze EHR and EMR data? What's the benefit and what's the challenge? How to apply text-mining and data-mining in non-structural or semi-structual data analysis? How to deal with compliance and HIPPA? How to deal with multiple EMR systems and diffential format? the importance of genetic/genomic information in health care managment? the importance of the heatlh history of the patients?
