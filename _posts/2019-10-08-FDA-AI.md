How to apply Artificial Intelligence in medical diagnosis and medical device from [US-FDA policy](../slice/US-FDA-Artificial-Intelligence-and-Machine-Learning-Discussion-Paper.pdf)? More and more patents based on [artifical intelligence]() occured in medical diagnosis and medical service, however, FDA have its own policy in the usage of AI in medical production. Here, we discussed the best approach to design machine learning and AI in production strategy design. Usually, we will have training dataset and test dataset in the machine learning modeling. Here, I will use an example to introduce the best way to apply AI in your production *design*.
