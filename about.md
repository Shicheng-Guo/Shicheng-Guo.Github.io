I'm Shicheng Guo, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. 

I received my Ph.D. degree at [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University) in 2014 under Prof. [Li Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Li) and full support from Prof. [Jiucun Wang](http://hupi.fudan.edu.cn/en/people/jiucunwang) and Prof. [Momiao Xiong](https://sph.uth.edu/research/centers/hgc/xiong/). After the post-doctoral training at [University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UT Health)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas_Health_Science_Center_at_Houston) and [University of California, San Diego (UCSD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_San_Diego), I joined Dr. Steven Schrodiâ€™s lab at [Center for Precision Medicine Research at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute](https://www.marshfieldresearch.org/profiles/14795). I made series contribution on Human [PBMC](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000533)methylome, [Silk](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1626) methylome and [tissue-of-origin](https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.3805) mapping by cell-free circulating DNA methylation. Now, I am focusing on genetic epidemiology and the diagnostic and prognostic roles of epigenetic variations in human complex disease, especially human autoimmune disease and cancer. In the Marshfield Clinic, I will make full use of his bioinformatics, big data analysis and text mining skills to valuable Marshfield Personalize Medicine Research Project dataset (including 20,000 Exome-chip data and comprehensive clinical and epidemiological information) and Roadmap, Blueprint, Encode project to identify disease susceptibility genes and epigenetic markers for early diagnosis or real-time prognosis surveillance.
