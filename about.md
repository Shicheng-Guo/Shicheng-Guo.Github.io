I'm Shicheng, a biologist turned bioinformatician turned data scientist. 

I received my Ph.D. degree in [Fudan University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fudan_University) under Prof. [Li Jin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jin_Li), a famous population geneticist in China. Meanwhile, I received full support from Prof. [Jiucun Wang](http://hupi.fudan.edu.cn/en/people/jiucunwang) and Prof. [Momiao Xiong](). After the post-doctoral training at University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UT Health) and University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Dr. Guo joined Dr. Steven Schrodiâ€™s lab at Center for Precision Medicine Research at the Marshfield Clinic Research Institute. Dr. Guo made series contribution on Human PBMC methylome, Silk methylome and tissue-of-origin mapping by cell-free circulating DNA methylation. Now, He is focusing on genetic epidemiology and the diagnostic and prognostic roles of epigenetic variations in human complex disease, especially human autoimmune disease and cancer. In the Marshfield Clinic, Dr. Guo will make full use of his bioinformatics, big data analysis and text mining skills to valuable Marshfield Personalize Medicine Research Project dataset (including 20,000 Exome-chip data and comprehensive clinical and epidemiological information) and Roadmap, Blueprint, Encode project to identify disease susceptibility genes and epigenetic markers for early diagnosis or real-time prognosis surveillance. 


My tool of choice for data analysis so far has been R. I also organize the . 


I love dancing and used to do competitive ballroom and latin dancing. Even though I don't have time for that anymore, I still enjoy teaching "social dances" once a week with the Hochschulsport (university sports courses).

I created the R package [exprAnalysis](https://github.com/ShirinG/exprAnalysis), designed to streamline my RNA-seq data analysis pipeline. It is available via Github. Instructions for installation and usage can be found [here](https://shiring.github.io/rna-seq/microarray/2016/09/28/exprAnalysis).

This blog will showcase some of the analyses I have been doing with different data sets (all freely available). I will also host teaching materials for students to access in conjunction with R courses I am giving.
